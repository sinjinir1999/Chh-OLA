In the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, Chh-OLA, the taxi-hailing startup led by Khanchandani, Harsh and Dwivedi garnered a lot of interest and funding from the investors. Five years later, Chh-OLA is successfully running a number of taxis on the streets of New Delhi and garnering significant profit.

Now, Chh-OLA has opened a Data Science division recently and you have been recruited into the division.
